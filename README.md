- Another way is to run it from the editor through run menu option without debugger but make sure you have the simulator running
- To run on actual device connect the device using the USB and enable USB debugging is active on the device
- Also make sure the flutter extension is already added inside the editor
- Through this extension only you will be able to restart or hot reload the application.
